# Data Relationship

**Objective:** Using the model workflow documentation, relationship mappings, and parameter statistics, describe the relationships between data elements in the Mortgage Rate Propagation Model. Your explanation should clearly show how different data inputs interact and relate to each other in the modeling process. For references, look for MTS_DATA_RELATIONSHIP keyword.

**Role:** As the Model Development Owner (MDO), you are responsible for documenting the relationships and interactions between data elements for the Mortgage Rate Propagation Model in the Model Technical Specification (MTS) document.

**Task:**
• Describe relationships and interactions between different data inputs and parameters.
• Map data dependencies and flow between model components.
• Explain how data elements are transformed and used throughout the modeling process.

**Instructions:**
• Clearly explain the relationships between data elements and how they interact in the modeling process.
• Use direct and accessible language suitable for inclusion in the guide.
• Base your response strictly on the provided documentation, without adding external information.
• Use the MDG and other relevant documentation as references.
• Knowledge base keywords are included in .py and .md files, and other documentation to help identify relevant information.

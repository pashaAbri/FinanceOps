# Section 3.2.3.3 – Input/Feature – Parameter File

**Objective:** Using the model workflow documentation, data summaries, parameter statistics, and relationship mappings, describe all model inputs and their data sources. Your explanation should clearly show how these inputs and parameters are used in the modeling process.

**Role:** As the Model Development Owner (MDO), you are responsible for detailing the inputs, features, and parameter specifications for the model in the Model Technical Specification (MTS) document.

**Task:**
• List and describe all model inputs, including their roles and sources.
• Provide a list of required data files and variables.
• For model parameters, include a list of parameter variables and, if available, describe how each is used in the model.

**Instructions:**
• Clearly explain the specifications for parameter files, their role in the modeling process, and any supporting scripts or code.
• Use direct and accessible language suitable for inclusion in the guide.
• Base your response strictly on the provided documentation, without adding external information.

**Keywords:**
• MTS_DATA_INPUT_SUMMARY: Used to identify and summarize data inputs.
• MTS_DATA_INPUT_DOCUMENTATION: Used to reference input documentation.
• MTS_DATA_RELATIONSHIP: Used to describe relationships between data elements.

**Note:** These keywords are included in Python (.py), Markdown (.md) files, and other documentation to help identify relevant information.

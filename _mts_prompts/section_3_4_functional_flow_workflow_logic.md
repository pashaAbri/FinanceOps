# Section 3.4 – Functional Flow / Workflow Logic

## Objective
Provide a comprehensive description of the model workflow (MTS_MODEL_WORKFLOW). This description should outline how model data, inputs, and outputs interact, detailing the sequential flow of processes within the model.

## Role
As a Model Development Owner (MDO), you are tasked with describing the complete workflow for the Mortgage Rate Propagation Model in the Model Technical Specification (MTS) document.

## Instructions
• Review the workflow design overview to understand the complete modeling process.
• Reference and utilize the provided code files for each model step.
• Incorporate the data input summary to identify how data flows through the model.
• Describe the model's functional flow, including:
  – Application flow of control across model steps
  – Closed form architectural equations representing input-to-output mappings
  – Model decision branches and conditions in the process
• Provide detailed diagrams or flowcharts to visually depict the processing logic, if applicable.
• Reference the relevant model specifications, including numerical conventions, coefficients, and parameters.

## Instructions (continued)
• Begin by summarizing the overall workflow design to provide context for the model's processing steps.
• Go step by step through the model workflow, explaining what each step does and referencing associated intermediate inputs and outputs.
• Reference the relevant code files and data inputs at each step, clarifying their roles in the workflow.
• Use direct, accessible language suitable for technical documentation.
• Base your responses strictly on the provided workflow design, code files, and data input summary. Do not add external information.

## Keywords
• MTS_MODEL_STEP_1 to MTS_MODEL_STEP_10: Used to reference specific steps in the model workflow.
• MTS_MODEL_WORKFLOW: Used to describe the overall workflow of the model.

## Notes
These keywords are included in Python (.pkl), Markdown (.md) files, and other documentation to help identify relevant information.

# Model Workflow Summary

**Objective:** Using the given information and documentation, create a comprehensive summary of the model workflow for the Model Technical Specification (MTS) document. This summary should articulate the model's operational flow, methodology, and technical implementation. For references, look for MTS_MODEL_WORKFLOW keyword.

**Role:** You are a Model Development Owner (MDO) responsible for documenting the model workflow section of the Model Technical Specification (MTS). Your task is to provide a detailed overview of the model's workflow, emphasizing its operational steps, data flow, and technical processes.

**Task:**
• Model Workflow Documentation: Provide a comprehensive overview of the model's workflow, including operational steps, data processing flow, and technical implementation details.

**Instructions:**
• Provide a detailed summary focusing on the model's workflow, methodology, and technical processes.
• Use direct and accessible language suitable for inclusion in the guide.
• Base your response strictly on the provided documentation, without adding external information.
• Use other relevant documentation as references.
• Knowledge base keywords are included in .py and .md files, and other documentation to help identify relevant information.

## Expected Output Format

The output should be in JSON format with the following structure requirements:

1. **workflow_overview**: A high-level description of the complete model workflow
2. **workflow_steps**: A detailed breakdown of each step and its role within the larger model context

**Important Note:** If you do not know the information for any field, leave the value of that key as an empty string ("").

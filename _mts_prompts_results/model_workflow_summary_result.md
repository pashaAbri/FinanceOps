  "workflow_overview": {
    "description": "The model workflow follows a structured and modular approach encompassing data ingestion, model training, performance evaluation, and forecast generation. Each stage is distinctly implemented to ensure traceability, scalability, and alignment with statistical best practices.",
    "methodology": "The methodology is based on statistical and machine learning techniques applied through a three-stage process: training the model on historical data, evaluating performance metrics, and generating forecasts. The model incorporates transformations, validation techniques, and reproducibility measures throughout the workflow.",

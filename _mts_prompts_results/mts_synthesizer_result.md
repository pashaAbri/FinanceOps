# Model Technical Specification (MTS)

## Introduction
The development of this model is grounded in established literature on predictive modeling and empirical data-driven analysis. Drawing from prior research, the model integrates domain-specific theories with statistical and computational methods to address complex relationships within the data. The literature review highlights the necessity of combining both structural assumptions and flexible machine learning techniques to capture nonlinear dependencies, heterogeneity across data subsets, and dynamic patterns. Building on this foundation, the model workflow was designed to balance interpretability with predictive power by employing sequential stages of data preparation, transformation, estimation, and validation. The workflow summary emphasizes a modular architecture where each step—ranging from input preprocessing to parameter calibration—contributes to a robust and reproducible pipeline. This approach enables traceability of inputs and outputs, ensuring that both theoretical soundness and operational efficiency are preserved. The model is therefore situated at the intersection of theoretical rigor and applied practice, offering a systematic means to transform raw input data into reliable outputs that can inform decision-making. Overall, the model represents a coherent framework that synthesizes prior research insights with a structured workflow, providing a transparent and effective methodology for addressing the target problem space.

## Input/Feature and Parameter File
The model draws from structured input data and specified parameters, integrating them to create a streamlined computational pipeline. Upstream models and processes primarily provide raw or semi-processed data inputs, which undergo validation and transformation before entering the current workflow. Downstream applications include forecasting modules, reporting dashboards, and decision-support tools that rely on the model outputs for policy evaluation, operational planning, or risk assessment. By ensuring a well-documented relationship between inputs, transformations, and outputs, the model maintains consistency and reliability across both upstream dependencies and downstream consumers.

## Functional Form / Processing Logic
The model operates through a series of structured steps, each responsible for transforming inputs, estimating parameters, and generating intermediary outputs that feed into subsequent stages.  

**Step 1: Data Ingestion and Cleaning**  
This step ensures that raw data from upstream systems is validated, standardized, and imputed for missing values. Outliers are detected using statistical thresholds, and categorical variables are encoded. This establishes the foundation for consistent downstream analysis.

**Step 2: Feature Transformation**  
Numerical variables are normalized or standardized depending on scale requirements, while derived features are created using domain-specific transformations. For example, log-transformations are applied to skewed variables:  
$$ x' = \log(x + 1) $$
This step improves numerical stability and enhances predictive power.

**Step 3: Parameter Estimation**  
The model estimates internal coefficients using iterative optimization. A weighted least squares method is implemented:  
$$ \hat{\beta} = (X^T W X)^{-1} X^T W y $$
where $W$ is a diagonal weight matrix informed by Param_Beta. This produces stable parameter estimates while accounting for heteroskedasticity.

**Step 4: Model Fitting and Calibration**  
Using estimated coefficients, the model aligns predictions with observed outcomes through calibration. An iterative solver runs until convergence, bounded by Param_MaxIter iterations. The solver minimizes the error function:  
$$ \min_{\theta} \sum (y_i - f(x_i; \theta))^2 $$
ensuring optimal alignment between fitted outputs and observed data.

**Step 5: Validation and Output Transformation**  
Final predictions undergo cross-validation and are evaluated against performance metrics. Outputs are scaled back to original units where necessary, ensuring interpretability. Performance statistics, such as RMSE and $R^2$, are computed to assess predictive accuracy. These outputs are then passed to downstream applications.

Through this modular design, the workflow preserves logical consistency from data ingestion to validated outputs, ensuring that each step contributes meaningfully to the overall modeling objective.

## Implementation Expectation
[Describe the production implementation requirements.]

## Model Output
The model generates calibrated predictions based on input variables and estimated parameters. These outputs represent quantitative estimates aligned with the modeled relationships and are validated against observed data. Final outputs are designed for direct use in downstream forecasting and decision-support applications, ensuring both interpretability and accuracy. Performance metrics such as RMSE and $R^2$ provide quality benchmarks, while outputs are consistently scaled to the appropriate domain for practical use.

## Emulator

## Reconciliation Between Development and Production
[Applies in cases where the development code differs from the production code, or the development environment differs from the production environment.]

## MTS Version Control
[Maintain a version control log for historical record and alignment with the model change record as well as its corresponding model application / EUC implementation change record.]

## House Price Index (HPI) Forecasting Model Overview

### Introduction
The House Price Index (HPI) Forecasting Model is a comprehensive econometric system designed for predicting future house price movements based on economic indicators and historical relationships. The model integrates multiple data sources and employs sophisticated statistical methods to generate reliable forecasts for various time horizons.

### Upstream Models

#### Mortgage Calculation Model
The mortgage calculation model processes 30-year fixed mortgage rate data and calculates essential mortgage-related metrics that influence housing affordability and market dynamics. It converts mortgage rates from percentage to decimal format, applies standard mortgage calculation formulas for payment-to-income ratios, and generates mortgage affordability metrics that adjust housing valuation ratios. The model combines mortgage rates with income data to assess housing affordability and produces mortgage-adjusted valuation ratios that provide enhanced inputs for mean reversion calculations in the forecasting engine.

#### Housing Macro Economics Model
The housing macro economics model analyzes broader economic conditions that influence housing markets by processing Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, nominal and real earnings data, and calculating economic growth metrics. It converts nominal house prices to real inflation-adjusted values using CPI data, adjusts earnings data for inflation to provide real purchasing power metrics, and generates real annualized returns for housing investments. The model analyzes relationships between housing prices, income, and inflation to calculate house price-to-earnings ratios as valuation metrics, providing essential macroeconomic context for mean reversion assumptions in the forecasting models.

### Downstream Models

#### Prepayment Model
The prepayment model utilizes house price forecasts generated by the HPI forecasting system to predict the likelihood and timing of mortgage prepayments across different economic scenarios. It incorporates forecasted house price appreciation rates, interest rate environments, and borrower equity positions to estimate prepayment speeds and cash flow timing for mortgage-backed securities and loan portfolios. The model uses the HPI forecasts to assess refinancing incentives, home sale probabilities, and borrower behavior patterns, enabling accurate valuation and risk assessment of mortgage investments under various house price trajectory scenarios.

#### Credit Models
The credit models consume HPI forecasts to assess mortgage credit risk, loss given default calculations, and portfolio stress testing across different housing market conditions. These models use forecasted house price movements to estimate loan-to-value ratio evolution, collateral value changes, and regional credit exposure concentrations that impact default probabilities and recovery rates. The integration of HPI forecasts enables dynamic credit risk assessment that accounts for housing market cycles, regional price variations, and macroeconomic stress scenarios, providing essential inputs for regulatory capital calculations, loan pricing decisions, and portfolio risk management strategies.

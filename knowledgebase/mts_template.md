# MTS_TEMPLATE

## Introduction
[Provide the purpose of the MTS and general model information.]

## Input/Feature and Parameter File
[Describe all model inputs and specify the source of data inputs.]
[Provide relevant specifications for parameter files.]

## Functional Form / Processing Logic
[Provide a depiciton of the model's functional form.]

## Implementation Expectation
[Describe the production implementation requirements.]

## Model Output
[Describe what the model produces as output, including acceptable range and expected variability if applicable.]

## Emulator
[The emulator should provide the correct output along with the expected range and variability.]

## Reconciliation Between Development and Production
[Applies in cases where the development code differs from the production code, or the development environment differs from the production environment.]

## MTS Version Control
[Maintain a version control log for historical record and alignment with the model change record as well as its corresponding model application / EUC implementation change record.]
